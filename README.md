# 🌿 Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website.

It is a space where I document what I learn — from places, from making things, and from trying to live well.

## About

I am a chemistry student with a wide range of interests:  
- Travel and photography  
- DIY projects and handmade gifts  
- Science and structured thinking  
- Personal growth and building balance  

This website is not a "perfect niche project."  
It is a long-term archive of exploration and reflection.

## Sections

The website is structured around four main areas:

- **Explore** – Travel photo essays and visual storytelling  
- **Make** – DIY projects and creative experiments  
- **Learn** – Thoughts inspired by studying chemistry and understanding systems  
- **Journal** – Reflections on balance, structure, and self-improvement  

## Purpose

The goal of this project is:

- To build something consistent and meaningful over time  
- To improve my writing and photography  
- To create a digital space that grows with me  

## Tech

This site is built using:
- GitHub Pages  
- (Add your framework here: HTML/CSS, Jekyll, Astro, etc.)

## Status

This is an evolving project.  
New content will be added gradually.
